# Generic Priority Queue Program

## Welcome to the Priority Queue program, written in Java!

This program implements a generic class that represents a queue with n priority levels, where n is a number in the range 1 to 10. Each member of the queue has a priority level from 1 to n, with 1 being the highest priority and n being the lowest.

The queue is implemented using the type parameter T, which allows it to hold elements of any type.

The Priority Queue class has the following methods:

[] add(T element, int priority): This method adds a new element to the queue with the specified priority.

[] poll(): This method removes and returns the element with the highest priority from the queue.

[] contains(): Check whether an organ is in the queue
