# Generic Priority Queue

This repository contains a Java project that implements a generic priority queue data structure. The `GenericPriorityQueue` class allows you to store and manage elements with different priority levels. The project includes the implementation of the priority queue and a sample usage scenario.

## Introduction

The `GenericPriorityQueue` class is designed to provide a flexible and efficient solution for managing elements based on their priority levels. Elements with higher priority values are dequeued before those with lower priority values. This priority queue implementation can handle a user-defined number of priority levels.



## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the Java classes using your preferred Java compiler or development environment.
3. Run the Main class to see the priority queue in action.

## Features
Flexible priority levels: You can define the number of priority levels when creating a GenericPriorityQueue object.
Efficient operations: The priority queue efficiently manages elements based on their priority, ensuring high-performance operations.
